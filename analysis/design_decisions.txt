Decision 1: Fact Table Grain
Choice: Option A: One row per encounter
Why: The chosen fact table grain is one row per encounter. This grain best supports the four analytical queries because encounters are the central
business event in the healthcare system. Monthly encounter counts, readmission analysis, and revenue aggregation all operate naturally at the
encounter level. Using a more granular grain such as diagnosis- or procedure-level would cause duplication of encounter-level measures like 
revenue and patient counts, leading to incorrect aggregations and increased storage and query cost. Diagnosis and procedure details are better
modeled using dimension or bridge tables linked to the encounter fact table.

Decision 2: Dimension Tables
- dim_date: date_key (PK), calendar_date, year, month, quarter, day_of_week, is_holiday
- dim_patient: patient_key (PK), patient_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, gender, mrn, age_group (derived, e.g., '0-18', '19-65', '65+')
- dim_provider: provider_key (PK), provider_id, first_name, last_name, credential, specialty_key, department_key
- dim_specialty: specialty_key (PK), specialty_id, specialty_name, specialty_code
- dim_department: department_key (PK), department_id, department_name, floor, capacity
- dim_encounter_type: encounter_type_key (PK), type_name (e.g., 'Outpatient')
- dim_diagnosis: diagnosis_key (PK), diagnosis_id, icd10_code, icd10_description
- dim_procedure: procedure_key (PK), procedure_id, cpt_code, cpt_description

But dim_diagnosis and dim_procedure will be connected to the fact table through bridge tables to avoid many to many relationships

Decision 3: Pre-Aggregated Metrics
Store: diagnosis_count, procedure_count, total_allowed, encounter_duration (discharge - encounter date in hours), is_readmission (flag for 30-day readmission)
Why: Pre-aggregating avoids runtime joins/calculations (e.g., total_allowed from billing join). This helps performance by reducing query-time aggregations, especially for revenue/month queries.

Decision 4: Bridge Tables
Yes, bridge tables will be used for diagnoses and procedures (many-to-many).
Why: Avoids denormalizing arrays/strings into fact table (inefficient for querying). Bridges allow flexible grouping without exploding fact rows.
 Trade-off: Slight join overhead, but better than OLTP's multiple junctions.
